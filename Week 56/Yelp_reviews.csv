Went for a quick business day lunch.  Server was attentive and informative.  A lot of options for lunch, at varying price points.  The interior reminds me of 131 Main, not too far away.  I had the crab cakes lunch.  Crab cakes were excellent - good chunks of crab meat, cooked perfectly.  They were a little on the small side, but it was adequate for lunch.  The Napa slaw was very good, but there was a huge portion of that on the plate.  I opted to upgrade my side to the skillet mac & cheese.  This was very tasty, but the up-charge was $4, which I thought was a little steep for that (the fries that come with the lunch are listed at $3.95 as a side item, the mac & cheese was $5.95, the up-charge should be $2 at most, right?).  I finished the lunch with the coconut cupcake.  I am very wary of coconut desserts as they tend to be overly sweet.  Not the case here, this coconut cupcake was perfect - the ""cake"" part was more like a shortcake than a cupcake.  The icing was a creamy toasted coconut, just sweet enough.  Perfection.  While I didn't have any drinks for lunch, I noticed that their wine selection and ""by the glass"" selections were excellent.",1,0,0,796J51vX9eu6BONfDBQMzw,B8FKS2jjTZ7xneWuadrH4w,B8FKS2jjTZ7xneWuadrH4w,Daniel,12,2013-03-11 00:00:00,2,0,0,0,2.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is reviewing the take out at Pinky's.  After having two take-out orders previously, we (3 of us from work) were very disappointed in the quality of food vs the price.   This time was a welcome change as the food was hot, fresh, correct, and very tasty.  Since we use to make the trek to the penguin, one would expect a few changes and breaking in period before the same level of quality would be reached here at Pinky's......well, let me tell you, the food is good!  My secret to having takeout is to place the order between 11:00 - 11:20am , that way you are one of the first ones to be in the restaurant when the other folks are just getting ready to head to lunch.  No lines, no looking for parking spaces, but let me assure you, eating at that early time slot takes some getting use to unless you are still in high school where lunch starts around 10:45am.  So I had the mammoth burger, 2-5 oz patties, with provolone cheese and bacon.  My Grease-O-Meter was running hot, and there is just nothing like having a big huge piece of hot meat in your mouth with a little cheese and bacon, oozing out of the corner of your mouth......OMG that sounded kinda gross when you read that didn't it.  (SORRY) we are talking about the burger!  My co-worker had the buffalo bites, I stole one from his plate while I was bringing the food back to work, and I must say that was delicious! Ssshhh don't say anything, but I had to ask him how they were, so he offered (another) chicken bite so that I may taste it. Just like the first one, it was excellent! I would consider the buffalo chicken bites next time as it did come with fries, unlike the burgers.    I give these guys a fighting chance.....after all you have to be tough to have a name like Pinky's on the West Side of Charlotte.  Overall, this location has greatly improved. I am only speaking of the takeout as I just do not have enough time at lunch to dine in and review the service of a full meal.  If you like the Penguin, you'll get a the same type of feeling here, good food, small space, no parking, long lines, and yes, some pricey food.
